    Zoom Phone API

    The Zoom Phone API allows developers to access information from Zoom. You can use this API to build private services or public applications on the [Zoom App Marketplace](http://marketplace.zoom.us). To learn how to get your credentials and create private/public applications, read our [OAuth](https://developers.zoom.us/docs/integrations/oauth/) documentation. All endpoints are available via `https` and are located at `api.zoom.us/v2/`.  For instance, you can list all users on an account via `https://api.zoom.us/v2/users/`.  **Note**: You will get `403` response `Zoom Phone has not been enabled for this account` if the phone account is not set up.  # noqa: E501
